# Visual Manipulation Relationship Network
## Introduction
This package includes our latest proposed robotic grasping algorithms. Main framework is based on code of Faster RCNN (https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch). 

Users for Pascal GPUs: you can skip the steps for building the C codes with Python because I have already done this. 

Users for other GPUs: you have to follow the installation steps from https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch to make sure that the components of Faster-RCNN work fine.

## Installation
1. Follow https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch to make sure that Faster-RCNN works fine.
2. Run codes.

## Training Example
```bash
python trainval_net.py --dataset (DatasetName) --frame (AlgName) --net (BackboneName) --cuda
# like:
python trainval_net.py --dataset vmrdcompv1 --frame all_in_one --net res101 --cuda
```

## Testing
```bash
python test_net.py --dataset (DatasetName) --frame (AlgName) --net (BackboneName) --cuda --checkpoint (PointNum) --checkepoch (EpochNum) --GPU (GpuNum, Default:0)
#like:
python test_net.py --dataset vmrdcompv1 --frame all_in_one --net res101 --cuda --checkpoint 1000 --checkepoch 1 --GPU 0
```

## Noteable Things
1. To train the network, you have to pre-download the pretrained models and put them in "data/pretrained_model" and name them the same as the usage in codes.
2. The training data should be placed or linked in "data".
3. The code will be improved continuously. Therefore, if you meet some problems, do not hesitate to contact me.
4. The included FPN and Focal Loss are uncompleted while Faster-RCNN and SSD can be used normally, though they are not the main contributions.
