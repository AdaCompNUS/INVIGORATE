## Standford core NLP for INVIGORATE

We apply standford core NLP to parse the command or answer from 
the human users. A library named stanford-corenlp-xx.xx.xx-models.jar
should be put in this directory. You can download the corresponding files 
following this link: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html

Also, you need to install stanza for its python API:
```bash
pip install stanza
```
